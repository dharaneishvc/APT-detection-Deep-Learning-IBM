## Detection and Prevention of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) activities in heterogeneous networks using Deep Learning

--------------------------------

### Abstract
Security vulnerabilities and breaches caused by malicious software attacks are a major security concern in this digital age. Malware detection continues to be a hot topic as many computer users, networks, organizations, businesses and governments are affected by the rapid growth of malware attacks. Many intrusion detection Systems have been developed to protect the data and resources from attacks. Sadly, new attacks and threats are developed every day, making it more difficult to these systems to detect those attacks. Not only the system has to detect an attack, but also it should prevent the attacks in network. To achieve this purpose an Advanced Persistent Threat detection system based on Deep Learning model can be developed as it has the potential to perform better in extracting features of data considering the massive cyber traffic in real life. In order to determine the efficiency of identifying anomalies, this work aims to examine deep learning artificial neural network algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and compare their efficiency in this research.
